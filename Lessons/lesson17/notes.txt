TREEEEEESSS

top node is root
siblings: have same parent
Leaf (external node): Has no children
Ancestor/descendant: path upwards/downwards which connects
subtree: Subset of tree (any node)
depth of a node: for any node, how far down from root
depth of a tree: depth of lowest Leaf



Post-Order Transversal:
1) print left node
2) print right node
3) print out payload

void postOrderPrint(BinNode* x){
  postOrderPrint(x->getLeft());
  postOrderPrint(x->getRight());
  cout << x->getData();
}
